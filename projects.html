            <h6>Arduino, C++</h6>
            <p>This Project was conducted using the Galvanic Skin Theory, which states that By applying a low constant voltage, the change in skin conductance (SC) can be measured non-invasively, to create a model of a heart rate monitor. 
              The project was conducted with the use of an ardukit, which included the arduino microcontroller as well as other componenets. The lab report is available in the link below, including clips of the code as well as a full explanation of the project

            <p>'Clamps' was a freshman project. We were required to build a robot to complete a task of our
              choice. My teammate and I decided to work on a 'pick-up' robot. Its original purpose was to pick
              up toys around a toddler's playroom, but we realized its purpose could further be expanded as a
              garbage collecting robot. The image shown is a working prototype of the robot. We intended to 3D
              print a box matching the dimensions of the one above using the Solidworks software, but
              
              decided to keep the more conservative option of a cardboard box.</p>

          <h6> Course Project</h6>
          <h6> Solidworks, COMSOL</h6>
          <p>This product was assigned for my Heat Transfer course. The problem given to us was: three “electronic chips” with initial heat needed to be cooled down given an initial material, and temperature. In addition, we were to create an ambient temperature using a block of air, with an initial velocity. Using the COMSOL program, we were to calculate the temperature to find the heat convection coefficient for the flat plate, pipe bundle, and straight fins. We can then compare and contrast the results between the pipe bundle, the fins and the flat plate and see which plate would be most efficient, and compare our results with our peers to see their results with varying free-flow velocity, Q, or initial temperature drastically change the results of the cooling of said chips. By observing the various values for the conditions put on each model we can see how to improve on the system in order to get a desired outcome. </p>

          <h6> Lab Reports</h6>
          <h6> Matlab, Simulink</h6>
          <p>This is a compilation of some relevent labs I conducted with my partner, Alyssa Mitchell. A control system is a system, which provides the desired response by controlling the output. This course provided a foundation in continuous-time linear control system
            analysis and design. Topics included modeling dynamic systems, system transfer functions, transient
            response and frequency response, stability, control system design methods in both time and frequency
            domains. 
            <br>➢ The need to study control system students needs a vast understanding of 2nd order ordinary
            differential equations and Laplace transform.
            <br>➢ Time domain transfer function and frequency domain transfer function are mainly used to
            solve open loop and closed loop systems.
            <br>➢ The understanding of Proportional (P), Integral (I) and Derivative (D) concepts and
            applications are used to understand mathematical and engineering process.</p>

          <p>This website was created as a means to not only practice my web development skills, but also as a means to digitize my portfolio, which prior to this was basically a bunch of printed out documents and pictures of my projects. Making an online portfolio let me put everything on one memorable platform. I deployed the site through github pages as it was a free alternative to sites like Wix and it would also let me test out my git version control skills. Below is a link to the repository</p>

          <p>This is a link to a github repository where I store PLC programming code that I have written in class. A Programmable Logic Controller, or PLC, is more or less a small computer with a built-in operating system (OS). This OS is highly specialized and optimized to handle incoming events in real time, i.e., at the time of their occurrence.

            The PLC has input lines, to which sensors are connected to notify of events (such as temperature above/below a certain level, liquid level reached, etc.), and output lines, to which actuators are connected to affect or signal reactions to the incoming events (such as start an engine, open/close a valve, and so on). This particular course only covered Structured Text and Instruction Ladder, The next step after this would be Mechatronics I, which covers ladder diagrams</p>
